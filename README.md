# Learning Record & Micro-Certifications

This repository is a structured archive of my continuous learning progress, documenting micro-certifications, foundational modules, and short courses completed across multiple platforms.

It serves as a **complementary record** to the main Professional Portfolio, which highlights only **major certifications and career milestones** (e.g., Google Cybersecurity, SC-900, Security+, CySA+, AZ-500, AWS).

## Platforms
- **TryHackMe** – Micro modules, rooms, and foundational labs (excluding paid premium courses)
- **Coursera** – Short courses, skill certificates, and micro-certifications
- **Fortinet Training** – Free training modules and exercises (NSE 1-3)
- **University Coursework** – Relevant academic modules
- **Udemy / Cisco / Other Free Resources** – Basic courses or short learning paths

## Structure
Each platform is organized into its own folder. Each micro-certification or course entry includes:

- Certificate image (if available)
- Brief description of the skill or topic
- Completion date
