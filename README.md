# Learning Record & Micro-Certifications

This repository is a structured archive of my continuous learning progress.

It contains micro-certifications, short course completions, and foundational modules completed across multiple platforms.

## Platforms
- TryHackMe (modules, rooms, foundations)
- Coursera (short modules and skill certificates)
- Fortinet Training
- University coursework (relevant modules)
- Cisco Networking Academy (introductory courses)

## Structure
Each platform is documented with:
- Certificate image (when available)
- Brief description of the skill or topic
- Completion date

This repository is designed as a transparent learning log rather than a highlight reel.

*Major certifications and career milestones are referenced from the main professional portfolio.*
