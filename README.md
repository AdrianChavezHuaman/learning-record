# Learning Record & Micro-Certifications

This repository is a structured archive of my continuous learning progress, documenting micro-certifications, foundational modules, and short courses completed across multiple platforms.

It serves as a **complementary record** to the main Professional Portfolio, which highlights only major certifications and career milestones.

## Platforms
- **TryHackMe** – Modules, rooms, and foundations
- **Coursera** – Short courses and skill certificates
- **Fortinet Training** – Training modules and exercises
- **University Coursework** – Relevant academic modules

## Structure
Each platform is organized into folders, and each micro-certification includes:
- Certificate image (when available)
- Brief description of the skill or topic
- Completion date

This repository is designed as a **transparent learning log**, rather than a showcase of selected achievements.
