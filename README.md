# Learning Record & Micro-Certifications

This repository is a **structured archive** of my continuous learning progress, documenting **micro-certifications, foundational modules, and short courses** completed across multiple platforms.

It serves as a **complementary record** to the main Professional Portfolio, which highlights **major certifications and career milestones**.

---

## Platforms

- **TryHackMe** – Modules, rooms, and foundational labs (excluding paid premium courses)  
- **Coursera** – Short courses, skill certificates, and micro-certifications  
- **Fortinet Training** – Free training modules and exercises (NSE 1–3)  
- **University Coursework** – Relevant academic modules  
- **Udemy / Cisco / Other Free Resources** – Basic courses or short learning paths  

> Only **micro-certifications or foundational courses** that are free or part of subscription plans are included here. Paid premium certifications and major career milestones are **documented in the main Professional Portfolio**.

## Documentation

Each micro-certification entry includes:

- Certificate image (if available)  
- Brief description of the skill or topic  
- Completion date  

This repository is designed as a **transparent learning log**, rather than a curated showcase of selected achievements.

---

## Purpose

- Continuous tracking of learning progress across multiple platforms  
- Easy reference for personal growth and review  
- Documentation of foundational skills in cybersecurity, systems, and SOC practices  

> Major professional certifications, paid courses, and key career milestones are referenced **only in the main Professional Portfolio**.

---

## Notes

- Maintain clarity and scalability for hundreds of micro-certifications.  
- Each certification should have a **dedicated `.md` file** with an optional image.  
- Use **relative paths** for images for portability.  
- This structure ensures all learning is documented without overcrowding the Professional Portfolio.
